# Prducer-Consumer with Kafka

Prerequisite: Docker and Golang compiler  
Ensure to have docker up && running.

1. To start working with the repository, start the zookeeper and kafka-server containers

```bash
make kafka
```
In-case `broker` container fails to start, do `sudo docker container rm zookeeper broker` to remove pre-existing container images and build again.

2. Build api and consumer bin files

```bash
make build
```

3. Start the api-server by

```bash
make deploy
```

4. Start consumer-server in a new terminal instance by

```bash
make consumer
```
This can result in error if the topic or partition in kafka does not exists. Please POST atleast 1 entry to /recieve endpoint before starting consumer.

## API Endpoints

POST `/recieve`: To recieves the product and user details.
